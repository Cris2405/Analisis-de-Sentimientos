Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,NOTE,3.0,Sameer Patil,"Which iPhone you should Purchase ? iPhone 8, X, XS, XR ?"
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees.,1.0,Amazon Customer,Don't buy iPhone xr from Amazon.
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon,5.0,A,Happy with the purchase
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and thereâ€™s a glitch in the front cameraâ€™s portrait mode. Thatâ€™s fine, it may happen. But whatâ€™s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!",1.0,Shubham Dutta,Amazon is not an apple authorised reseller. Please take a note.

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,I was delivered a phone that did not work immediately after removing from the box. I was not able to return it as I need to first check with Apple.

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome.

Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and Iâ€™m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife.

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"Don't buy Apple products from Amazon. I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything.

They didn't change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating.",1.0,Amazon Customer,Horrible Experience with Amazon
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,Face recognition is slower some times. I have no complaints about it. I am die hard fan of XR. I was eagerly waiting for dual sim iPhone. Itâ€™s heavy but looks are so attractive that you will be ready to carry that little extra weight. I am using it since two months. Donâ€™t watch any reviews. Just buy it and enjoy.

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down.,3.0,Nitesh,Disappointment for an iPhone

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well. All in all XR rules,5.0,Neel,Go for XR if you confused between X and XR

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,Best iPhone Iâ€™ve used. Sold my one plus 6 and got this one. The screen is not an OLED so you miss out on deep blacks and saturation. But I noticed the colours are better than the older iPhones with LCD. It also has thick bezels which take some time to get used to. An OLED screen on this wouldâ€™ve been wonderful but apple being apple wont do that!,5.0,Suraag,Amazing phone! iOS makes it worth the money! Delivered 3 days late by the seller.
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,Poor Front camera cannot take photo with light at background (photo attached),1.0,Amazon Customer,Worst camera
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"This is my first phone from Apple. I was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone. Even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments, I went for iphone due to craziness. The product is well packed and delivered. When I started using the phone, the screen looks average, battery is good and the hardware seems good. The camera disappoints me al lot. Never expect this from Apple. In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera.  At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market.",1.0,Dinesh,Disappointed !!!
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,This Appario seem to be a fraud. My shipment has been smartly tampered and the have managed to overcome the security features.

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"Like every time, Apple has again mesmerised me with itâ€™s great creation iPhone XR. The best part in this is when you unbox your brand new iPhone. It comes with an earpod, and a Fast charger. I understand that the price might be a bit high but trust me, itâ€™s worth it. The camera has the best feature within it. Everyone says that itâ€™s an LCD screen but youâ€™ll nit be able to differentiate just by looking at the screen. The phone performance  is more faster now. And last but not the least, I am really impressed with the battery back up time. It really lasts. Full charge at 10 am and then the whole day on Cellular Data, I have played PES2019, played some songs from YouTube Music, hovering on Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook and clicked some good photos. When i came back home at 11 oâ€™clock, i still had 66% charge. Thatâ€™s what we needed in an iPhone.",5.0,Kusan Majumder,The Best Choice !

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,Has many drawbacks. Apps developed for iPhone by Indian Companies arenâ€™t good at all. You canâ€™t even do a normal Tatkal booking as irctc app unavailable. No dual Whatsapp so one number is wasted. No dual Facebook as well. Maximum 5gb cloud backup storage limit. Apps get refreshed more frequently and better enhancements on android. No features to search apps easily. Wifi once disconnected loses auto join features. Maximum 100 call records thatâ€™s very very annoying. Difficult to set primary and secondary sims in sms.

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"I was skeptical looking at some XR reviews and also purchasing an iPhone off Amazon (previously always bought through Apple Stores). However, so far happy with what I have. The delivery was fast (on Prime, next day)",,,
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,I got a defective iPhone XR. The screen is defective. Thereâ€™s a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen. The phoneâ€™s working completely fine though.  So whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe itâ€™s something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didnâ€™t. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still donâ€™t blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. Itâ€™s disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didnâ€™t upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone.,2.0,Mandeep Kumar,Got a defective screen product delivered.

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,Got this product in the amazon flash sale and got a decent discount. Have been using the device for a few days and can certainly say that this iPhone has the best battery life till date. Phone lasted for almost 30 hours with heavy usage. The face recognition has certainly been improved from iPhone X. The only thing I dislike about the phone is the Screen Quality. You wonâ€™t find any major difference in the screen quality unless and until you stream Netflix or watch YouTube.

This is the perfect Phone with all advanced features for a normal user, which is worth for the price. Moving unto the flaws seen on the feedbacks, most of them complaining about the display being low resolution and LCD. In my opinion you wonâ€™t spot any difference with other iPhone displays. Another thing Iâ€™ve seen than lot of people complaining about the single camera, however, the picture quality you get will amuse you.",5.0,Sobin Thomas,Never mind the negative reviews- used review- Excellent phone.
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"Bought this during Prime sale. I love to use Apple products because of its simplicity. I was using iPhone 6 and thought of updating. While the XS and XS Max are more than a Lakh in India, iPhone XR is bang for the buck. The prime day deal was more sweet and surprise to me. The operation and touch responses are silky smooth. Dual Sim with the eSIM works like a charm. Rear camera is awesome with face detection AI Bookeh in Portrait mode. Screen resolution is very good and crisp without any pixel issues. It lacks 3D Touch but Apple incorporated Taptic Engine which will be updated to replace 3D Touch functionality eventually (though some are present now, it is limited). Some APPs are not good in the notch area though but it is ok to manage. Overall a nice update.",5.0,S. Chandrasekaran,Amazing iPhone with great offer from Amazon

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,Face ID and front camera portrait mode isn't working just after 3 months of purchase. It must be a problem of true depth sensor.

My iPhone 7 was 3 years old, and was lagging before I took the leap. Camera is more like the android phone with some Chinese lens I think. Battery life is so soothing!

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"I ordered this phone on Diwali offer. The phone which I got first had display issue , so I got replacement for that.my previous phone was iPhone 6 Plus.  After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review.  Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10% to 100%. As I am used to iPhone home button, Iâ€™m feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So itâ€™s a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as u have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if u use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when u have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory.",4.0,Ravi Kiran C R,Great battery life

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"First of all the Face ID is crazy fast and accurate even during pitch darkness. The phone is fast and smooth, you donâ€™t feel like you are having just 3Gb of RAM, it handles anything you through at it without a hitch. The phone does feel premium and at the same time delicate because the backside is glass,â€as you know glass is glass and glass will breakâ€. The pictures taken from the camera are good but the lack of night scape sort of things is a con. Overall the phone is great, although the side bezels are thick, you get used to it. The LCD screen does not lack anything compared to the OLEDâ€™s in day to day usage. You just stop thinking those things when you are using daily.",4.0,nithin,iPhone XR review

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,Well Iâ€™m writing this review after 3months of usage.,4.0,Haripreethi,Itâ€™s not a wow one but we can go for it
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"Writing this review after 1 week of usage. Purchased the 128 GB version during the freedom sale for 57k. I was confused between One plus 7 Pro, IPhone XS and the XR and I must admit that it turned out to be a good decision. Its a classy product and feels premium in hand compared to other devices in this price range. The features that the other phones boast about are hardly being used in day to day life unless you are an avid gamer. The screen size is just perfect and quality is not bad as being highlighted in some of the reviews on youtube. Battery life is excellent, camera is very good and the phone is waterproof. Performance is excellent with A12 Bionic processor.",5.0,Pankaj Singh,Excellent phone!!
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"I used to be an apple hater but no other phone ever matches the gaming optimisation of the iPhone XR/XS/XS Max. These devices with the A12 bionic chip just beat any other android devices in graphics rendering performance without a doubt. People have been complaining about the display that is basically 828p but trust me, you wonâ€™t even notice the difference between a proper 1080p screen and this one. In fact this screen looks better than most of the 1080p mobile phone screens (thanks to the liquid retina display technology it uses). The camera is amazing in all aspects and one of the best out there in the smartphone market but it canâ€™t click portraits without detecting a human face (P.S. you can download an app named halide at the appstore to click non human portraits).",5.0,Sreyanshu Roy,"Buttery smooth performance, the real value for money iPhone."

Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,One of the best iPhone ever. Features are fabulous and battery life is excellent. On an average it lasts up to 10 hrs if you are an extensive phone user.

Iâ€™ll give 10/10,5.0,Manu Kamal,Best iPhone ever
Apple iPhone XR (64GB), India ,"The camera quality is not as good as I excepted it to be.

Battery performance is good... with normal usage it gives around 24hrs backup while with heavy usage 12-13 hrs backup u can definitely get. But charging adapter  in the box is very pathetic. I just ordered an 12W fast charger at 1K from amazon. It is a smart choice to get iPhone Xr at 40K over iPhone 11 at 59 K (Including HDFC bank offer).
